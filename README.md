# CSC413-Project
 CSC413 Project code

This is the code we (Team 91) used to run experiments on. 

new_RNN.py contains code for the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm that predicts one time step into the future and new_LSTM.py contains code for the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) which is an artificial RNN architecture capable of learning long-term dependencies (predicting multiple time steps into the future), especially in sequence prediction problems such as cryptocurrency price prediction.

These models can be used to predict future cyrptocurrency prices. For the sake of simplicity as well as making dataset gathering easier, we consider the historical data of bitcoin prices as our dataset for this project.
